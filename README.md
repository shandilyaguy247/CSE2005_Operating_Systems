# CSE2005_Operating_Systems
Contains all the Lab Tasks for the course CSE2005 Operating Systems (Vellore Institute of Technology). You can use these codes in a bash terminal and save yourself one semester worth of hassle. (dozens of bash terminals available online, although I personally prefer the OG linux one like in the lab).
