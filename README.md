# CSE2005_Operating_Systems

Contains all the Lab Tasks for the course CSE2005 Operating Systems (Vellore Institute of Technology). You can use these codes in a bash terminal and save yourself one semester worth of hassle. (Dozens of bash terminals available online, although I personally prefer the OG linux one, like in the lab).

## Prerequisites 

You will need a bash terminal. There are dozens of bash terminals available online (although I personally prefer the OG linux one, like in the lab). If you have access to a linux machine, awesome. If not, alternatives work too.

## Usage

There are 5 Lab Tasks (Keeps changing every year but broadly this is how it goes). Each Task has its individual folder.
In each folder, you will find the code to a particular problem. (I've covered almost of the problems that you will be asked to perform in the lab)

## Contributing
Pull requests and any corrections to the codes are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
